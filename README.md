Grade 12 Computer Science Final Project

This was my attempt at a first person shooter written in Java using the [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) framework.

Renders with OpenGL ES 2.0

I'm pretty proud of what I got done in the time that I had! So take a look here: [FPS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id4I8V8uH_M)


Note: This project was made using Eclipse before the gradle project was used.
